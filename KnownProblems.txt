This ASCII file is to contain a description of any known problems or issues with your 
assignment. If you know something doesn't work or you assignment is incomplete document
it here so that the markers don't waste time trying to figure out if there is 
some sort of build problem or issue when it is simply the case that things aren't
working.

- Processes don't close (program halts/lags after trying to kill, but the process doesn't die) because I put a while loop. Issue with keyboard problem
- Most of it was working when I developed on the Linux grad machines then I tried to copy it to my local and everything broke

Problems now: 
sysread isn't waiting / it is looping 'command not found' when there is no input
Everything has to be done slowly or it lags like crazy and stop working
